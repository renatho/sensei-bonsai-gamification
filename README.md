# Sensei Bonsai Gamification 

Make your courses more fun with this gamification plugin for Sensei, where the students can claim Knowledge Bonsais in their learning process!

### TODO:

This project is a work in progress. Some pending items:

- Issue that copies the unique ID when copying a Knowledge Bonsai block.
- Ranking block (maybe "My Bonsais Forest block").
- Bonsais design.
- Sounds design.
- Animations design.
- Implement i18n.

### Future ideas

- Growing Bonsai block (a block that the user can claim only after X seconds in a page).
- Perseverance Bonsai (when accessing the courses many days in a row).
- Be able to claim Bonsais in some specific actions, like completing courses. It also needs a nice feedback for the user.
- The points can be exchanged for things, like a coin.
- Be customizable to have different assets than Bonsai.
